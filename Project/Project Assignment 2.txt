Objective:

The goal of this assignment is to finalize the project scope and demonstrate meaningful progress on system modeling, data collection, and experimental planning. 

1. Final Problem Statement

Clearly describe the finalized system, and its scope.
Define system boundaries and highlight any updates from the previous submission.
2. Input Data Analysis

Identify the data required for the simulation or analysis.
Describe:
Data sources (e.g., real-world data, assumed/synthetic data, literature)
Data collection methodology (e.g., surveys, observations, public databases)
Include summary statistics, distributions, or tables if data is already collected.
3. Modeling 

Describe the planned modeling methodology.
Describe key entities, events, resources, and interactions in the system.
Include a basic structure or initial sketches of your simulation model (e.g., AnyLogic screenshots, logic diagrams).
4. Output Data Analysis

Define the key output variables and performance metrics to be tracked.
Discuss how outputs will be analyzed (e.g., comparison of scenarios, sensitivity analysis).
5. Experimental Use Cases

List experimental scenarios you plan to test in your model (e.g., policy changes, bottleneck analysis, resource optimization).
Briefly describe:
What-if scenarios or parameter variations
Expected insights or hypotheses to be tested
Guidelines:

Total Marks: 50

Due Date: Friday, 18 April 2025 (EOD)

Maximum Length: 5 pages (excluding references and appendix) - font size >= 10

Figures & Tables:

Key figures and tables should appear within the first 5 pages
Supporting diagrams, or screenshots should be placed in the appendix
Appendix May Include:

Model screenshots or simulation block diagrams
Additional data tables or code snippets
Supporting figures or analysis results

Group Submission: Only one submission per group is required

Academic Integrity Note:

Resemblance or direct usage of AnyLogic sample models, examples from the AnyLogic library, or models available online (e.g., GitHub, blogs, forums, etc.) will be treated as plagiarism.
Such submissions will be reported immediately and the team will receive zero marks for the project.
You are expected to create original models and project-specific logic based on your own understanding and the system you choose.
